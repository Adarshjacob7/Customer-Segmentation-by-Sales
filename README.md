# Customer-Segmentation-by-Sales
Built a customer segmentation dashboard using RFM analysis on customer, product, and order data. SQL was used to compute recency, frequency, monetary values and scores, and assign customer segments. Tableau visualizations include RFM distributions, segment comparisons, F vs M scatter, and an RFM heatmap.
